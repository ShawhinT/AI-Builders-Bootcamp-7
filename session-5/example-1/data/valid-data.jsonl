Picturing this every time I see a summary stat helped me have a better understanding of reality.\n\n2) Conditional Probabilities\n\nOnce I imagine a distribution in my head, it\u2019s important to understand how this distribution will change in light of new evidence.\n\nFor example, the probability a business survives 4 more years is 54%, however, if the business has been around for a year, this probability jumps to 62%\n\n3) Expectation Values\n\nProbabilities help us make decisions under uncertainty, but they are not the only thing that matters. You also need to consider potential upside and downside.\n\nFor example, even if a new business venture has a 10% chance of success, if success means $10M in profit, it still makes sense to pursue it.\n\n4) Fat Tails\n\nWhile the majority of stats we learn in school center around the normal distribution (i.e., bell curve), many things follow a different distribution\u2014a Pareto (i.e., 80-20 rule).\n\nNormal distributions focus on the typical. However, it is often the atypical, rare event that makes an impact e.g. 1% of customers can make up 50% of sales!\n\n\nWhat are some stats concepts that shaped your thinking?\n\n--\nIf you liked this post, repost it and follow me (Shaw Talebi) for more :)"}]}
